* Shivam Pawar - Description

* Prathamesh Ghogare - Description

* Nayan Taori -  
 I have learnt the use of Kotlin language in app making and also learnt more functioning of Android Studio. I have also learnt about how to add more beautiful UI to a page of an app. Also learnt a bit about Firebase and enjoyed working with the team where I learnt to be more patient when the app was getting crashed due to some errors in code. It was fun how we tried to debug the code and succeeded.

* Rishabh Jain - 
 I have learned to use kotlin in android, how firebase works, how authentication can be done (Google, Email, Phone, etc.), how ui works, how to work with Multi-Moduled projects, how payment methods are integrated to app, also, how powerful and helpful, the git and github are.

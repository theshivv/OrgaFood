 I have learnt the use of Kotlin language in app making and also learnt more functioning of Android Studio. I have also learnt about how to add more beautiful UI to a page of an app. Also learnt a bit about Firebase and enjoyed working with the team where I learnt to be more patient when the app was getting crashed due to some errors in code.
